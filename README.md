## Quizzical - A quiz game made in React

This is my third React project, a quiz game which uses an API to generate new questions each time you play.

I attempted to make this game without following any guide or assistance, so its probable that there is places where it could be improved.

The source code is also commented to explain how everything works.

After answering the questions you can submit your answers, and your score is displayed, and your average score is tracked between sessions.

## Current TODO:
- I believe it to be feature complete, although I may revisit at a later date to improve the CSS and cleanup the code.


## Technologies Used:
- HTML 
- CSS
- React
- Github Pages
