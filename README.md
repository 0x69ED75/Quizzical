## Quizzical - A quiz game made in React

This is my third React project, a quiz game which uses an API to generate new questions each time you play.

I attempted to make this game without following any guide or assistance, so its probable that there is places where it could be improved.

The source code is also commented to explain how everything works.

After answering the questions you can submit your answers, and your score is displayed.

## Current TODO:
- Add a feature which tracks the user average score between sessions.
- Add a feature allowing the user to choose the difficulty and topic of questions.
- Make a better end game screen, and attempt to put which questions the user got correct and which they got incorrect
- Improve the CSS styling on answer buttons so that they have better styling when the answer exceeds 2 lines of text.
- Improve play again feature, currently uses a hack solution to reload the main application, which causes it to not run as expected.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML 
- CSS
- React
